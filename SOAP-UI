Soapui GUI freezes in 64 bit Windows. To overcome this problem some files should be changed in the installation directory.

In “INSTALL_DIR\bin\soapUI-3.6.1.wmoptions” file the vm argument below should be added

-Dsoapui.jxbrowser.disable=true

If you want to start SoapUI via batch file. You should uncomment the line below in the “INSTALL_DIR\bin\soapui.bat” file.

set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dsoapui.jxbrowser.disable=”true”
